# CPP Letter Grade Converter

This is extremely simple, but it's meant to just show a starting point with my C++ skill level. 

This is my first ever C++ project.

Used this as a way to learn about C++ "maps" which I know as dictionaries. Also used to learn for loops and conditional statements in C++ also used to strengthen knowledge on C++ Data types and C++ Syntax and structure.
